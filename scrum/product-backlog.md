# Product backlog

As we talked in the key Agile concept, product backlog is the list of all the features to be added, enhancements to be made and all the fixes required in the product.

Initially, when we started the process, we will make a list of all the requirements based of our understanding at that point in time. As the project progresses, we may add new requirements, change all or some requirements or even delete some of the requirements. The backlog is always evolving an never fixed.

The changes to the product backlog are bought by the stakeholders or the business team. They are the one who listen to the market feedback and note the changes in the conditions and technology. Based on this input, they identify the new features that should be added or fixes to be done in the existing product.

Once these changes are brought to the Scrum team, the product owner add them to the product backlog. Then, the product owner, along with the development team, added them to the requirements. This process is called **product backlog refinement**.

## How it is done

The requirements come from the business team and they are **raw**. The requirements are not raw from the user journey perspective or the business perspective but from the technical standpoint.

For example, if the requirement is to send a notification to users who have abandoned the shopping basket without making payment, from the technical side, we need to see that we have the required permission to do that. Maybe we can do it for Android app but not for iOS app but it is fine for Windows. These are some of the things which the business team may not be aware of and therefore the requirement may be wrong.

Now, the product owner needs to fill the following table for each of the requirements.

| Order no. | Requirement name | Requirement details | Estimated Business Value | Estimated effort | Ready? |
|-----------|------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|------------------|--------|
| 1         |                  |                     |                          |                  |        |
| 2         |                  |                     |                          |                  |        |

There are multiple columns in this table. There are columns like order number, requirement name and so on. In this table the requirement name is to be given by the business team. The requirement details are filled by the product owner after the discussion with the business, development team or any other relevant experts. Estimate business value of the requirement is also provided by the business team. Once all of this is done, the product owner discusses this with the development team to find out the estimated effort for each of these requirements in terms of hours or story points.

When the estimation is done for both estimated value and the estimated effort, the product owner arranges these requirements in the order they have to be done.

The last check for each requirement is whether all details have been captured clearly and can be done within in one sprint time box. If everything is find, the requirements is ready to be picked up in the next [sprint planning](../scrum/sprint-planning.md) (and the last column is updated).

>[!NOTE]
> Only the business team can give the business value estimate and only the development team can give the effort estimate.

Based on the estimations, the product owner decides the order of requirements. The [Scrum master](../scrum/scrum-master.md) needs to be ensure that the entire process of backlog refinement does not take more than 10% of the capacity of the development team.

>[!NOTE]
> Duration of backlog refinement should be less than 19% of the capacity of the development team.

The product backlog is a list of everything to be done and this list can be really long. We don't have to refine all the requirements. This refinement is usually for the top priority requirements only. So, only the things are expected to be picked up in upcoming sprints are refined.

Now, the ultimate agenda of building a product backlog is to increase transparency, which means that both the entire Scrum team and the stakeholders should be aware of what has been done, what will be done next and how much time will it take. You can see the product backlog has all the necessary information to do the same. The product owner can also use tools like [burn down charts](../agile/burnchart.md) to monitor the performance. All of these, the backlog, the charts etc should be visible to everyone to ensure transparency.

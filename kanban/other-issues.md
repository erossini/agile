|-----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 1   | Too much work in progress (WIP) on a single stage - **[Limiting the WIP](../kanban/process-inefficiencies.md)** | More team members need to work on that stage(for e.g. testing stage in this scenario) instead of any of the previous stage |
| 2   | **[Under utilization of resources](../kanban/underutilization-resources.md)** - Pending tasks not moving to the next step | Reallocate the resources somewhere else where they can be utilized optimally |
| 3   | **[Task is taking longer time than it should be](../kanban/unequal-sized-tasks.md)** | Keep a regular track of the board - Break down the task into smaller sized tasks |
| 4   | **[Multiple feedback loop](../kanban/marking-task.md)** | Make a mark on the task for the number of rounds that task is going for rework |
| 5   | **Having a lot of external dependencies** | Develop a practice of regular follow ups on tasks listed in “Tracking” column - No need of a WIP limit on this column |
| 6   | **Team required to work on non-product features** | Create a task for such features and keep a track on the same |
| 7   | **Automate/Upgrade tasks** | Add such improvement tasks also on the board |
| 8   | **Assigning work to new person** | Assign the new person to the slowest step |

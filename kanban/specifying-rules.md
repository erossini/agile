# Specifying rules

This is quite an important thing that exists only in Kanban. As we said many times, Kanban doesn't have standard rules.

If you know [Scrum](../scrum/intro.md), you would know that it has very strict rules to be followed and the entire team knows about the rules. In fact, there is a special role call [Scrum master](../scrum/scrum-master.md) who ensures that everyone knows about hte rules. With Kanban we do not have these rules or special roles.

There is not set rule for when we should have daily standup; who moves the tasks or when; there is no Kanban master. There may or may not be a [Sprint planning](../scrum/sprint-planning.md) meetings or [Sprint review](../scrum/sprint-review.md) meetings. So, the point is rules are not fixed and each team has to come up with its own rules for implementing Kanban.

When you create rules, you must make sure that these rules are explicitly mentioned and everyone understand them clearly. This does not mean that the Kanban team has to write long document specifying the entire process. Making policy explicit can be as simple as writing WIP limits on top of the columns. The team should define **Done**. When a team decided the [Definition of Done](../kanban/definition-of-done.md), the definition must be explicit for everyone and always visible or easy to read.

Any rule or practice you adopt as part of implementing Kanban should be explicitly mentioned so everybody is on board.

Since the entire team collaboratively creates these rules, you may think that this may not be really useful. Suppose a manager or the boss is trying to push some work. If the WIP limits are explicitly mentioned and the manager has agreed to the policy of WIP limits, the team has solid ground that only if an exiting job is taken off the list, then only the new job will find its place.

Explicit policies not just helps within the Kanban team but also helps in the interaction of the Kanban team with other stakeholders in the organization.

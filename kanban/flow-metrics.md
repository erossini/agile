# Flow Metrics

If you are working in Kanban (or any other framework), there are common questions you will face:

> By when will the work be completed?

> How much of the work will be completed in this release?

These are questions with a not clear answer because we need to predict the performance of the team and we need to be able to predict the output of our process. So, the process needs to be predictable but there must be some uniformity and less randomness in the performance of the team. If the process is predictable, then we should note and measure some important values or metrics that can help us predict the performance and answer the customer's questions.

First, we look at the metrics of interest that is metrics which are important for us:

- WIP: Work in progress
- Throughput
- Cycle time

Once we understand their definition and know how these are calculated, then we will look at **Little's law**. This law establishes a relationship between these three metrics what a predictable process.

# Daily Standup

Now, we have a board to visualize the process, there is one daily regular meeting prescribed by Kanban to make the most of this. This daily meeting is called **Daily Standup**. [Scrum](../scrum/intro.md) has a similar practice which is known as [daily Scrum](../scrum/daily-scrum.md).

>[!TIP]
> Kanban is flexible with no Scrum rules

However, there are major differences between these two. The reason for the differences is the same thing we have been seeing from the beginning of Kanban: Kanban is flexible whereas Scrum has strictly rules.

When we say strict rules, it means that Scrum has rules?

- How long the meeting will be?
- Who will be handling the meeting?
- What will be discussed in the meeting?

Kanban has no such rules. Any member of the team can run the daily Standup (even if this member has just joined the team). Maybe every day a new team member gets the chance to run the meeting and bringing a new flavour to the meeting. Maybe this job is assigned to the senior most person of the team. However, usually the project managers are seen doing this because this keeps them up to date on the status of the tasks. If there is some task blocked or some member needs help, they can do so. It is always a team choice who runs the meeting.

There is no fixed duration of this meeting. If the team is experienced, they can finish it up within five minutes. There is no problem is a meeting takes 30 minutes and members talk about their successful job or issues.

The meeting is about moving the tasks forward if they have not done it earlier. Although people can move the tasks by themselves, if something is missing, the stand up is a time to get the board up to date. Apart from this, the team should try to identify issues and if there are facing any problem in the task.

General rule of thumb, keep the focus on the board and try to add or get as much value out of it as possible.

## What a Daily Standup is not

The Daily Standup is not a review meeting or demo or features built or discussion about the product. You can have these meetings separately. Standup meeting is just a get together to see how the work is flowing through the process.

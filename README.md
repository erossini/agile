# Welcome to the Agile documentation!

This is a collection of document about Agile in general but in particular about Scrum, Kanban and Extreme Programming (XP). At the moment, I don't talk about other framework like SAFe, Kata, DAD or LeSS.

I'm putting together this documentation to help me and my teams to understand this methodologies better and create a reference and resources for everybody.
